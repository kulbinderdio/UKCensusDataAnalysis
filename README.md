# UKCensusDataAnalysis

This project is aiming to show a way of loading the UK Census 2010 data into a Postgres database and analyse that data using Jupyter Notebook.
For this we will be using Python, Postgres, PostGIS, QGIS(possibly), GeoPandas and other tools.

For a detailed description of the Census data have a look at https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census
During the course of this projet I will endeavour to explain terms that are specific to this data and area of analysis such as OAs, LSOAs, MSOAs, etc
